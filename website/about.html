      <h1>About Me</h1>

      <section>
        <h2>Professional Background</h2>
        <p>
          I’m a cloud and DevOps engineer driven by a strong interest in technology,
          systems, and problem-solving. My background interest in science—particularly
          physics and biology—shapes how I think about systems: understanding how
          individual components interact to produce reliable, scalable outcomes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Cloud engineering is my way of contributing useful, practical solutions to
          the world. This portfolio represents the beginning of a long-term focus on
          building secure, automated, and well-designed systems that solve real
          problems.

        <h2>Personal Interests</h2>
        <p>
          Outside of technology, I am a competitive mixed martial artist. I actively
          train and compete in Brazilian jiu-jitsu, wrestling, and kickboxing, and I
          participate in competitions every few months.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also coach jiu-jitsu, wrestling, and MMA classes, which has strengthened
          my communication skills, discipline, and ability to mentor others in
          high-pressure environments.
